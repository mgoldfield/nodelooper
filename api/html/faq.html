        <p><b> Can I use Zoom or other video chat software while using loopmagic!?</b><br/>
        We have tested it with Zoom and it works well to have both zoom and loopmagic! running at the same time.  Facetime created some issues that we have not investigated yet. </p>
        <p><b>Can you edit tracks once they're recorded?</b><br/>
        There are not currently plans to allow editing.  If you want to edit a track, or do any other mixing/processing that's not currently available, we recommend downloading the project and throwing it in the editor/mixer of your choice.  </p>
        <p><b> How long to projects last? </b><br/>
        Projects currently last for 5 days, after which they are automatically deleted. There may be a way to keep projects longer for a storage fee in the future. </p>
        <p><b> How do I use MIDI instruments with loopmagic!? </b><br/>
        You have to route the audio created by whatever MIDI software you're using to an input of your computer.  You can do this physically by connecting an audio cable from your midi output to the input loopmagic! is using, or you can do this via software, explained <a href="https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010526359-How-to-route-audio-between-applications">here</a>.<br/>
        </p>
        <p><b> Can I record multiple channels, e.g. stereo?</b> <br/>
        Currently loopmagic! only records mono tracks.  However, you can upload stereo tracks from file via "load file"</p>

        <p><b> I want to get in touch with the creator / maintainer </b><br/>
        Let me know if you want a new feature or if you've found a bug! Contact me (Matt) at loopmagic.contact [*at*] gmail [*dot*] com. <br/>
        </p>
        <p><b> How is loopmagic! supported? </b><br/>
        Currently, loopmagic! is a passion project maintained by me (Matt).  Help keep loopmagic! free by joining the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mgoldfield">loopmagic! patreon page</a>.<br/>

        <p> Special thanks to Daniel Dickison for his contributions and encouragement in getting this over the line. </p>
